=== Todo:

* Create key pair for the admin node to use in the deployment
** *CONCERN* Biggest problem is getting the public key for the student host, to populate each nodes' authorized_keys file 
** Likely for the admin node
*** Need to be able to specify public key to add to authorized_keys
** Possibly easier to generate them into the .terraform directory then use the file provisioner to copy in
** Can also start with a static set of keys for the nodes
** Instructor host needs to have the public keys of all student hosts
*** Then can create an authorized keys file for each deployment containing:
**** Instructor host
**** Student host
**** Admin node

* *DONE* Copy .all_nodes and ssh_config files to the admin node

* *DONE* Remove load balancer

* Test deploying onto multiple KVM hosts

* Find way to do nested deployments

* Deploy a single deployment across multiple KVM hosts (providers)
